# Student Monitoring System - Backend

The primary goal of this backend system is to support the monitoring of students' attendance, academic performance, behavior, and well-being. It serves as the backbone for enhancing school administration and facilitating communication between the educational institution and students' guardians.

## Features

- **Attendance Tracking**: Stores and manages students' attendance records.
- **Academic Performance Analysis**: Provides APIs to retrieve and analyze academic data.
- **Behavioral Monitoring**: Facilitates the storage and querying of students' behavioral patterns.
- **Well-being Assessments**: Manages data related to students' overall well-being.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and access control using JWT.
- **Data Encryption**: Ensures sensitive information is securely stored.

## Benefits

- **Reliable Data Management**: Centralizes student information for efficient access.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Supports future expansions and increased user demands.
- **Secure Communication**: Protects data integrity and privacy through robust security practices.
- **Integration Ready**: Designed to integrate seamlessly with frontend applications.

## Technologies

This backend system utilizes the following principal technologies:

- **Flask (2.3.0)**: A lightweight web framework for building APIs.
- **Flask-SQLAlchemy (2.5.1)**: For database interactions and ORM functionality.
- **Flask-CORS (3.0.10)**: To enable secure cross-origin resource sharing.
- **Werkzeug (2.3.0)**: For request and response handling.
- **MySQL-Connector (2.2.9)**: For seamless database connection and communication.
- **mysql-connector-python (9.1.0)**: For advanced MySQL database operations.
- **Flask-JWT-Extended (4.7.1)**: To implement JSON Web Token authentication.
- **Flask-Bcrypt (1.0.1)**: For secure password hashing.

## Usage

1. **Setup Database**: Configure and initialize the MySQL database.
2. **Environment Configuration**: Set up environment variables for database credentials and JWT secrets.
3. **Run the Server**: Start the Flask application to serve the APIs.
4. **Integration**: Connect the backend to the frontend for seamless data flow.
5. **Monitor and Scale**: Use logs and monitoring tools to ensure reliability and scalability.
